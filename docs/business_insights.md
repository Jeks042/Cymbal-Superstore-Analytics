# Business Insights — Cymbal Superstore

This document summarises the key insights derived from the analytics and modelling work, written for non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 1. Customer Base Health

- The customer base is large but highly heterogeneous
- Churn risk is not evenly distributed
- A small proportion of customers account for a disproportionate share of revenue risk

---

## 2. Churn Risk Concentration

- New Customers drive churn risk by **volume**
- Loyal Low Spend customers drive churn risk by **probability**
- Champions are fewer but still represent meaningful value exposure

This indicates that churn is driven by **different mechanisms across segments**.

---

## 3. Value at Risk

- Total value at risk is significant relative to revenue
- High-priority customers represent a small share of the base but a high share of exposure
- Retention efforts should be **prioritised, not uniform**

---

## 4. Retention Dynamics

- Retention drops sharply after the first purchase
- Customers who survive early months show more stable long-term behaviour
- Retention patterns differ significantly by segment

This suggests that **early lifecycle intervention** is the most effective lever.

---

## 5. Strategic Implications

- Improve onboarding and first-to-second purchase conversion
- Design differentiated retention strategies by segment
- Allocate retention budgets based on value at risk, not customer counts
- Track retention using cohort-based metrics rather than global averages

---

## 6. Executive Summary

This analysis enables Cymbal Superstore to move from reactive churn reporting to **proactive, value-driven retention strategy**, ensuring that marketing and CRM resources are focused where they generate the greatest return.
